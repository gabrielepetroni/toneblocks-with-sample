# Toneblocks
Toneblocks is a web based musical creative coding environment, built with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) and [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).

Originally developed as my thesis project for the Master of Music in Music Technology requirements at NYU Steinhardt.

It is the basis for a paper/poster/video presentated at [NIME 2021](http://nime2021.org/program/#/paper/122) titled *Toneblocks: block-based musical programming*, co-authored with [Willie Payne](https://williepayne.com/).
