# Toneblocks With Sample
Toneblocks With Sample is an updated version of the original [Toneblocks](https://github.com/mdquigley/toneblocks), built with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) and [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly). Its goal is to expand its capabilites by adding the capability to play audio samples indefinitely and use audio effects to modify the sound's output, making it closer to a complete Live Coding software and environment.
